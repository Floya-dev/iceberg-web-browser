# ICEBERG / ZERO-TRUST WEB BROWSER
Inspired on the [Tails](https://tails.net/) (kinda)

# INITIAL IDEA
This browser is missing some features of a normal browser for security measures, some of them can be turned on in the settings.
The use of this browser can vary: Personal use (home, for children), Enterprise use (for workers and non IT specialists).
- Cookies are not functional from the start. / No saved passwords on your machine, no chance for password grabbers for taking them.
- Downloads are disabled, from the start. / You cannot download any files from the internet by default, prevents random downloads of malware.
- Website blocklist. / A basic blacklist will be implemented from the start, but can be modified. Including porn websites, scam links, sketchy links, piracy websites..
- AdGuard implemented. / Like Brave we will implement an AdBlocker, to avoid clicking on sketchy ads.
- No history. / This browser wont save your search history.
